## Tasks
### 0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
- `libdynamic.so` - a dynamic library containing all the functions in the header file.
- `main.h` - Header file containing function prototypes.
### 1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
- `1-create_dynamic_lib.sh` - a script that creates a dynamic library called `liball.so` from all the `.c` files that are in the current directory.
### 2. Let's call C functions from Python
- `100-operations.so` - a dynamic library that contains C functions that can be called from Python.
### 3. Code injection: Win the Giga Millions!
- `101-make_me_win.sh` - code injectin.
